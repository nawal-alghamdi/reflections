When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I will use it all the time because if anything happened to my local repository there is a copy online


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if there is more than one working on the same repository it's not important that I want all his changed. Or maybe I don't have
space on my laptop.
