What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .get repository will create. I need that because now I can keep track of my work by doing commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

So now we have the working directory and the git repository and the staging area. The staging area is the middle between the other two directories and I need it to group more than one file and then I can commit all the files together in a single commit
