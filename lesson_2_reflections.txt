What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .get repository will create. I need that because now I can keep track of my work by doing commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

So now we have the working directory and the git repository and the staging area. The staging area is the middle between the other two directories and I need it to group more than one file and then I can commit all the files together in a single commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

After written my changes (one logical change) on the file and then run git status I will found the file that I just made the change in. Then I can add just the file that I made the change in to the staging area then commit the change so now I have commit one logical change.
